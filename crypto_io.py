# Ideas for new features:
# - Include your name or contact info in the comments and/or opening scroll.
# - Write some messages or stories and encrypt and save them to disk for your family and friends to discover.
# - Include color codes - red for failed encryption, green for passed (see the lesson Hexadecimal\Character Codes).
# - This program includes functionality you haven't seen in the form of file I/O, string formatting, and imported
# modules. See if you understand what's going on and reference the online documentation if you don't.
# - Errors are handled, but the user navigation could be more friendly (e.g. allowing users to return to a previous menu
# rather than forcing them to stick with the choice to encrypt or decrypt, even if they change their mind). Try expand-
# ing it!
# Prevent the user from attempting a Ceaser shift greater than +-26, or use mod (%) to correct it

# Advanced features:
# - Create a puzzle for users to solve by slowly ramping up the difficulty (e.g., the key to a block cypher could be
# written in a ceaser cypher (as a word - remember, our ceaser cypher only substitutes letters), and that block cypher
# could have a clue to a Diffie-Hellman cypher, and...)
# - Display the checksum or hash of messages as they are encrypted and decrypted.
# You could even save the checksum/hash alongside the messages, so users know if a file has been modified.
# - Expand your cyphers with more options, or write a new one from internet tutorials.
